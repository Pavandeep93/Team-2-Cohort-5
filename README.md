# **Project Background**
**Why is Pharmaceutical Drug Spending Important?**

Pharmaceutical spending is a key component of healthcare expenditure worldwide. It represents the cost incurred by individuals, governments, and insurance providers on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and self-medication.
In recent years, rising drug costs have raised concerns regarding:
Affordability: Higher drug prices make essential medications inaccessible to lower-income populations.
Healthcare Policy: Policymakers and governments aim to balance innovation incentives for pharmaceutical companies while regulating costs.
Economic Burden: Pharmaceutical spending impacts GDP, public health budgets, and insurance systems.



# **Project Overview**

# **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
    
**Heatmap of correlation**

<img src="https://github.com/tqq199548/Team_2_Pharmaceutical_Drug_Spending_by_Countries/blob/main/Backup-Pictures/correlation_heatmap.png" width="500">


To gain an initial understanding of how the variables interact, a correlation heatmap was generated. Several noteworthy correlations emerge:

- **PC_HEALTHXP** and **PC_GDP** show a relatively strong positive correlation(0.72), suggesting that countries spending a higher percentage of GDP on pharmaceuticals also tend to allocate a larger share of their health budgets to pharmaceuticals.

- **PC_GDP** and **USD_CAP** display a moderately high correlation(0.64), indicating that as pharmaceutical spending rises relative to GDP, per capita spending in USD also tends to increase.

**Visualizing missing years and selection of timeframe**

![alt text](https://github.com/tqq199548/Team_2_Pharmaceutical_Drug_Spending_by_Countries/blob/main/Backup-Pictures/pivot_table.png)

This pivot table clearly illustrates data availability across different countries and years. Each green cell represents an existing observation for a given country-year combination, while the white cells highlight missing years.From this visualization, we can quickly see which years and countries are most densely populated with data. For instance, certain earlier years may have sporadic coverage, whereas more recent years often feature more consistent records. This overview is crucial for determining where data imputation will be needed. 

To complement the pivot table, we also generated a summary table that lists, for each country, the total number of observations, the count of missing values, and the percentage of missing data specifically from 2011 to 2021. This numeric breakdown helps us quantify data gaps more precisely.


## Rationale for Using 2011‚Äì2021
 - **Recency and Relevance**: By narrowing our focus to 2011‚Äì2021, we ensure our analysis captures modern trends in pharmaceutical spending, making our insights more applicable to current policy and market decisions.

- **Consistent Coverage**: Both the pivot table and the numeric summary reveal that most countries have more comprehensive data for this recent decade. Limiting our scope to these years minimizes the extent of missing values and, consequently, reduces the need for imputation.

- **Reduced Complexity**: A decade-long timeframe offers a balanced window for capturing meaningful variations in spending without digging deep into older and potentially less relevant data. This more focused dataset is easier to manage and helps us draw clearer comparisons across countries.


# **Data Exploration**

**1. Identify Top 10 and Bottom 10 Countries (based on USD per capita pharmaceutical spending):**

**-Top 10 Countries:** 

<img src="https://github.com/tqq199548/Team_2_Pharmaceutical_Drug_Spending_by_Countries/blob/main/Backup-Pictures/Top%2010%20spenders.png" width="500">

**Key Observations:**

The USA leads significantly, with the highest per capita spending Other high spenders include: Malta (MLT) ‚Üí A comparatively smaller economy country with high per capita spending. Switzerland (CHE) ‚Üí Known for its robust healthcare system. France (FRA) ‚Üí Major European economy with steady healthcare investments

**-Bottom 10 Countries:**

<img src="https://github.com/tqq199548/Team_2_Pharmaceutical_Drug_Spending_by_Countries/blob/main/Backup-Pictures/Bottom%2010%20spenders.png" width="500">


**Key Observations:**

Gradual Increase: The spending increases gradually from the top to the bottom of the list, with the last country on the list having the highest spending among these ten, approaching 400 USD. The list includes a mix of countries from different regions, such as Europe (Croatia, Estonia, Denmark), the Middle East (Israel), and Latin America (Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia). This indicates that low spending per capita is not confined to one specific region but is a global issue.

**2. Scatter Plot Review on Outliers**

<img src="https://github.com/tqq199548/Team_2_Pharmaceutical_Drug_Spending_by_Countries/blob/main/Backup-Pictures/Scatter%20plot.png" width="500">

**Key Observations:**

PC_GDP vs USD_CAP (Outliers Highlighted): The scatter plot reveals a general positive trend between avg PC_GDP and avg USD_CAP, **indicating that higher GDP per capita is associated with higher capital expenditure**. Outliers, highlighted in red, are primarily concentrated at higher avg PC_GDP values (around 1.5 to 2.0), with significantly higher avg USD_CAP values compared to the rest of the data. These outliers correspond to specific years and locations (e.g., USA in recent years), **suggesting unique economic conditions or policies that result in exceptionally high capital expenditure.**
